### Examples
The app could be integrated into different types of projects, be it related to tourism or history. One example of integration could be a VR tour that offers an opportunity to take selfies. Example (Ohio Today Magazine): https://ohiotoday.org/CollegeGreenVR/. 

### Inspiration
Selfie 360 was developed (and further improved) using Benson Ruan's "Selfie Anywhere" app (https://github.com/bensonruan/Selfie-Anywhere).
